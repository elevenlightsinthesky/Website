                Marcie was my princess, my baby girl who I cherished above all else.
                She was often my rock through a lot of challenging times in my life, always chirping and yapping away about something.
                Never a quiet moment with Marcie around, or as we affectionately called her Marce-hole, as she was constantly up to no good and letting the whole neighbourhood hear about it.
                I've never met a more vocal cat than her.
                But in the end, it was someone else's selfish idiocy that ripped her away from me.
                Our house is along a popular dog walking path, and this lady had her mastiff off leash.
                This so called "absolute sweetheart" ran into our back garden and ripped Marcie out of the plastic box which housed her outdoor bed.
                Dan couldn't pry it off and sustained severe injuries himself, but eventually it relented.
                She succumbed to her injuries, and they were so severe my mum had her wrapped in a blanket and begged me not to look under it - only at her face.
                She died just as noisy however:
                "Even under a sedative she didn't stop chatting away, she kept making them giggle." - Mum.

                "We adopted the boy when I was 12 or thereabouts, and he 3 or thereabouts.
                It was an adjustment; he spent much time hiding in my room, only nipping out for a bit of food or to meow at a closed door.
                But he did adjust! For one, fought his way towards running the neighbourhood territories.
                He was (and is) my best friend. He had this way of knowing when things got rough for me, always stubbornly sticking by me and headbutting me into feeling a little better.
                I know he was tired, and he couldn't move as fast as he used to - he looked ready to leave and then he did.
                I knew that. But I couldn't be there to see him off. I'm sorry, Errol. 
                I hope you've found someplace warm to nap, maybe a bit of company - you were too socialable, stealing the room every time someone came over.  
                It's been a couple of months: I'm doing better, but I ain't been the same since you left.
                I miss you." - John, my boyfriend and loving owner of The Boy
