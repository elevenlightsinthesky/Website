                           As of writing this (2025), the old man is pushing 17 and is still the king of the jungle (or the backyard and local field).
                           He spends most of his time sleeping and sunbathing, often getting dehydrated due to his black coat causing overheatig and yet having no intention of getting up to do something about it.
                           Diggle was originally my aunt's but she didn't want him anymore and dumped him on the streets as a defenceless kitten, so my mum drove straight over and he's been ours ever since.
                           Incredibly loyal and has displayed the ability to sense when family is in distress, often seen curling up to the person and nuzzling them.
                           He has a defining feature of one ear as the other shrivelled from cauliflower ear - it doesn't hurt him, just got infected and didn't get caught in time to reverse it.
                           Purely a cosmetic issue so we love him regardless!

                            Snowy is large and in charge, 10 years old, often forgetting his size and attempting stunts only achievable by more physically superior cats; he is the reason there is a permanent dent in the back of the couch, and why the scratching post collapsed.
                            He is supposed to be a white cat but is often dirty and matted, notably with a black line down his back from under the car where he crawls - lovingly referred to as his racing stripe.
                            I have personally spent over Â£100 on groomers and tools to stop his fur from ever getting matted to the point of needing being shaved again.
                            Snowy is also not a fan of his baths, often being as vocal as he can with his meow left croaky from a throat infection.
                            Not to mention the kink in his tail from breaking it, and the fact that every summer we have to put suncream on his face to prevent cancer.
                            For a large lad with no desires outside of food, he's awfully high maintenance.

                            This little man was barely two weeks old when found in a wall nook next to a shop called Anzio's, go figure where his name came from.
                            Anzio is still mostly feral at the ripe age of 4, despite being hand reared by Dan since his discovery.
                            Due to this, Dan is the only one who can pick him up or properly scold him.
                            The creature of darkness prefers to stay engulfed in shadows, his only calling card being a swipe of deadly murder mittens or glowing yellow eyes.
                            Notable features: incredibly fast; sets off my allergies the most due to his constant self-grooming; eats food like he's been starved for years and will never eat again; fiesty but knows his place around the others; and was mortal enemies with Marcie.
                            Also, fun fact, his tail is constantly moving, and its completely subconscious.
                            Even to the point he has gotten annoyed at his own tail on several occasions and badly injured himself. What a goose.
